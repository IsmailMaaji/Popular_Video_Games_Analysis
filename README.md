# Popular Video Games Analysis

## Overview
I wanted to do this project because of my passion for playing video games and my desire to merge it with my skills in data analytics. As a gamer, I’ve always been fascinated by the gaming industry, the popularity of certain genres, and what makes some games stand out. This project is a chance to explore those questions using data.

The goal of this project is to analyze trends in the video game industry by leveraging data analytics tools like **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. Through this analysis, I aim to discover insights into the most popular games, how player preferences have evolved, and which genres dominate the market. By combining my passion for gaming with data analysis, this project showcases my ability to clean, process, and visualize complex datasets, turning raw data into actionable insights.

## Data
### Raw Data
The raw data in the `data/raw/` folder contains uncleaned game data including titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and player statistics.

### Cleaned Data
The `data/cleaned/` folder contains the cleaned data (`games_cleaned.csv`) after processing in SQL and Excel.

## SQL and Excel Cleaning
The `sql/` folder contains the SQL scripts used to:
1. Clean missing or inconsistent values.
2. Normalize genres into specific categories (Action, RPG, etc.).
3. Filter and transform data for analysis.
  
Additionally, Excel was used for more manual data transformations before uploading it to Power BI.

## Reports
- The Power BI report (`video_games_analysis.pbix`) in the `reports/` folder includes interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Analysis Goals
- **Identify the most popular video games** based on player numbers and ratings.
- **Visualize the top-rated games** and their performance over the years.
- **Categorize games into 7 main genres**: Action, RPG, Misc, Platform, Racing, Shooter, and Sports.
- Analyze trends in **player distribution**, **ratings**, and **game popularity** over time.

## Key Findings
- Action games dominate in terms of popularity, followed by RPGs.
- There is a strong correlation between high ratings and player engagement.
- Shooter games, while fewer in number, tend to have higher average player counts.

## How to Use
1. **Power BI Analysis**:
   - Download the Power BI file from the `reports/` folder.
   - Open it in Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations.

2. **SQL Cleaning**:
   - Review the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder to understand how the data was processed and cleaned.

3. **Data**:
   - The cleaned data file `games_cleaned.csv` can be used for further analysis in Excel or Power BI.
